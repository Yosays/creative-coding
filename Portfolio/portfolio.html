        <h1>Welcome to My GitHub Projects</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Yosyas Okbit I go by Yoshi, a passionate coder exploring the world of creative programming. Here are some of my favorite projects. Feel free to explore!</p>

                <p><strong>Dance Floor</strong></p>
                <p>This is a page of little squares that interchange in color I was aiming to make it look like
                    projector mall floor dance floors
                </p>
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="project">

                <img src="https://yosays.github.io/creative-coding/Portfolio/Shapless-Pic.png" alt="Shapless">
                <p><strong>Shapless</strong></p>
                <p>This is meant to be a screensaver I wanted it to be something that had no exact outcome 
                but still had something that a person can look forward to like anticpating what the next
                shapes will be or how long they will stay transparent or what color they would be
                which led to me come up with the name "Shapeless"</p>
            </a>

        <div class="project">
            <a href="https://yosays.github.io/creative-coding/unit3/Outer-Space/" target="_blank">
                <img src="https://yosays.github.io/creative-coding/Portfolio/Time-Pic.png" alt="Outer Space">
                <p><strong>Outer Space</strong></p>
                <p>This work like mentioned before is meant to be shooting stars out in space
                I added on stars to give it a more space look which led me to call this work "Outer-Space".
                Starting from the left they go up by each second, minute, and hour.
                    </p>

                <img src="https://yosays.github.io/creative-coding/Portfolio/Trials-Pic.png" alt="Trials">
                <p><strong>Trials</strong></p>
                <p>I called this trials because they way the sprite looks and the font reminded of undertale trials but
                    more to it also reminded me of a type of korean comic called "Manwha" which is riddled with dungeon and
                    reincarnation genre and leveling up and getting through near death expierences which reminded of that 
                    when the follower increases</p>
